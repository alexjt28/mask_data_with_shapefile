# mask_data_with_shapefile

This repository contains a Python script that can be used to mask gridded data with either 1- or 2-dimensional latitude and longitude coordinate data with a defined shapefile. The Python script is designed to run seamlessly with the conda environment 'modeling' in my Conda-envs repository.
